This a simpler version of Robert Martin's PyPortfolioOpt[1], partly for use by Imperial's Student investment Fund and also as part of my self-study of quantitative finance.

Like the original, I utilised ‘cvxpy’ (a Python embedded modelling language) for convex optimization problems as well as integrating it with ‘pandas’ data structures.

This is also coupled with Jupiter notebook tutorials which teach users how to utilise the library whilst also providing a foundational understanding of classical portfolio optimization methods such as Black-Litterman and Markovitz.
